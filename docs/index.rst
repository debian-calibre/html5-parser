A fast implementation of the `HTML 5 parsing spec
<https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#parsing>`_ for Python. Parsing is done
in C using a variant of the `gumbo parser
<https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser>`__. The gumbo parse tree is then
transformed into an `lxml <http://lxml.de/>`__ tree, also in C, yielding parse
times that can be **a thirtieth** of the html5lib parse times. That is a
speedup of **30x**. This differs, for instance, from the gumbo python bindings,
abcdef


Installation
--------------

Unix
^^^^^^

On a Unix-y system, with a working C99 compiler, simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --no-binary lxml html5-parser



You can setup html5-parser to run from a source checkout as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/kovidgoyal/html5-parser && cd html5-parser
    pip install --no-binary lxml 'lxml>=3.8.0' --user
    python setup.py develop --user

Windows
^^^^^^^^

On Windows, installation is a little more involved. There is a 200 line script
that is used to install html5-parser and all its dependencies on the windows
continuous integration server. Using that script installation can be done by
running the following commands in a Visual Studio 2015 Command prompt:


.. code-block:: bat

    python.exe win-ci.py install_deps
    python.exe win-ci.py test

This will install all dependencies and html5-parser in the :file:`sw`
sub-directory. You will need to add :file:`sw\\bin` to :envvar:`PATH` and
:file:`sw\\python\\Lib\\site-packages` to :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`. Or copy the files
into your system python's directories.


Quickstart
-------------

To use html5-parser in your code, after installing it simply do:

.. code-block:: python
    
    from html5_parser import parse
    from lxml.etree import tostring
    root = parse(some_html)
    print(tostring(root))


See the :func:`html5_parser.parse` function documentation for more details on
parsing. To learn how to use the parsed lxml tree in your program, see
the `lxml tutorial <http://lxml.de/tutorial.html>`__.

.. _xhtml:

XHTML
------------

html5-parser has the ability to parse XHTML documents as well. It will
preserve namespace information even for namespaces not defined in the HTML 5
spec. You can ask it to treat the input html as possibly XHTML by using the 
``maybe_xhtml`` parameter to the :func:`html5_parser.parse` function. For example:

.. code-block:: html

    <p xmlns:n="my namespace"><n:tag n:attr="a" />

becomes

.. code-block:: html

    <html>
        <head/>
        <body>
            <p xmlns:n="project">
                <n:tag n:attr="a"/>
            </p>
        </body>
    </html>

This is useful when try to parse a XHTML document that is not well-formed and
so cannot be parsed by a regular XML parser.

API documentation
------------------

The API of html5-parser is a single function, ``parse()``.

.. autofunction:: html5_parser.parse


Comparison with html5lib
-----------------------------

Before doing the actual comparison, let me say that html5lib is a great
project. It was a pioneer of HTML 5 parsing and I have used it myself for many
years. However, being written in pure python, it cannot help but be slow.

Benchmarks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a benchmark script named `benchmark.py
<https://github.com/kovidgoyal/html5-parser/blob/master/benchmark.py>`_ that
compares the parse times for parsing a large (~ 5.7MB) HTML document in
html5lib and html5-parser. The results on my system (using python 3) show a
speedup of **37x**. The output from the script on my system is:

.. code-block:: none

    Testing with HTML file of 5,956,815 bytes
    Parsing 100 times with html5-parser
    html5-parser took an average of: 0.397 seconds to parse it
    Parsing 10 times with html5-parser-to-soup
    html5-parser-to-soup took an average of: 1.685 seconds to parse it
    Parsing 10 times with html5lib
    html5lib took an average of: 13.906 seconds to parse it
    Parsing 10 times with BeautifulSoup-with-html5lib
    BeautifulSoup-with-html5lib took an average of: 12.683 seconds to parse it
    Parsing 10 times with BeautifulSoup-with-lxml
    BeautifulSoup-with-lxml took an average of: 3.826 seconds to parse it

    Results are below. They show how much faster html5-parser is than each
    specified parser. Note that there are two additional considerations:
    what the final tree is and whether the parsing supports the HTML 5
    parsing algorithm. The most apples-to-apples comparison is when the
    final tree is lxml and HTML 5 parsing is supported by the parser being
    compared to. Note that in this case, we have the largest speedup. In
    all other cases, speedup is less because of the overhead of building
    the final tree in python instead of C or because the compared parser
    does not use the HTML 5 parsing algorithm or both.

    Parser            |Tree              |Supports HTML 5   |Speedup (factor)  |
    ===============================================================================
    html5lib          |lxml              |yes               |50               |
    soup+html5lib     |BeautifulSoup     |yes               |15                |
    soup+lxml.html    |BeautifulSoup     |no                |20                | 


There is further potential for speedup. Currently the gumbo subsystem uses
its own data structures to store parse results and these are converted to
libxml2 data structures in a second pass after parsing completes. By modifying gumbo
to use libxml2 data structures directly, there could be significant speed and
memory usage gains.

XML namespace handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

html5lib has truly horrible handling of namespaces. There is even a source-code
file in it named :file:`_ihatexml.py`. Compare the result of parsing and pretty
printing the following simple HTML fragment (pretty printing is done via lxml in both
cases).

.. code-block:: html

    <p>xxx<svg><image xlink:href="xxx"></svg><p>yyy

With **html5lib**:

.. code-block:: html

    <html:html xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <html:head/>
        <html:body>
            <html:p>xxx<ns0:svg xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><ns0:image xmlns:ns1="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ns1:href="xxx"/></ns0:svg></html:p>
            <html:p>yyy</html:p>
        </html:body>
    </html:html> 

With **html5-parser**:

.. code-block:: html

    <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
        <head/>
        <body>
            <p>xxx<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><image xlink:href="xxx"/></svg></p>
            <p>yyy</p>
        </body>
    </html>

While both outputs are technically correct, the output produced via
html5-parser is much easier to read and much closer to what an actual human
would write. In particular, notice the unnecessary use of prefixes in
the html5lib output, as well as the ugly ``ns0`` anonymous prefix for the svg
namespace.

html5-parser also has the ability to optionally preserve namespace information
even for namespaces not defined in the HTML 5 standard. See the :ref:`XHTML`
section for more information.


Safety and correctness
--------------------------

The HTML parser is based on the `gumbo parser
<https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser>`__ which has undergone a Google
security review and been tested on 2.5 billion pages from the Google cache. In
addition, html5-parser passes (almost) all the tests from the html5lib test
suite. 

Finally, html5-parser is compiled with ``-pedantic-errors -Wall -Werror`` and
the test suite, consisting of thousands of tests, is run using the address and
undefined behavior sanitizers. Continuous integration testing is done on three
major OSes and four different compilers.
